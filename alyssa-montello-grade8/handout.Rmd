Dear students,

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you via Skype. I study statistics and genetics,
and I'm very excited to talk science with you.

To prepare for our Skype conversation, I have a few small requests. First, please read this short news story: https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2017/june/multi-parent-mouse-populations-reveal-genomic-secrets


Then, please complete this short survey:

Be sure to ask lots of questions in the survey.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
fred
